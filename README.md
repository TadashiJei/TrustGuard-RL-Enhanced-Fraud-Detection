## Introduction

Fraud detection is a critical challenge across industries. TrustGuard addresses this by combining machine learning techniques with reinforcement learning to continuously improve fraud detection accuracy. The system adapts to new fraud patterns in real time, making it a powerful solution for dynamic threat landscapes.

---

## Features

- **Blended Modeling:** Combines supervised and unsupervised learning for initial fraud detection.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Implements adaptive learning to improve detection accuracy over time.
- **Real-Time Detection:** Processes transactions swiftly to identify suspicious activities.
- **Scalable Design:** Handles large datasets and integrates easily with existing systems.
